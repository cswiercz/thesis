\section{The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Equation}

The primary goal of this thesis is to efficiently compute a large class of
periodic solutions, the so-called {\it finite genus solutions}, to the
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:kp}
  3u_{yy} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \big(
  4u_t - ( 6uu_x + u_{xxx} )
  \big).
\end{equation}
these finite genus solutions, as we will see, have a deep and fascinating
connection to the theory of complex algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces.

The KP equation appears in various applications, including plasma physics [XXX]
and the study of water waves [XXX]. For example, the KP equation can be derived
by taking shallow water, long-wavelengths, weakly two-dimensional
approximations of solutions to the Euler equation [XXX].

A major and important discovery due to Zakharov and Shabat [XXX] is that the KP
equation can be written as a Lax pair [XXX]. Let $\Psi = \Psi(x,y,t)$ be an
auxiliary wave function satisfying the linear system of equations,
\begin{align} \label{eqn:lax:pair}
  \Psi_y &= \Psi_{xx} + u\Psi, \label{eqn:lax-pair-a} \\ \Psi_t &= \Psi_{xxx} +
  \tfrac{3}{2}u \Psi_x + \tfrac{3}{4}(u_x + w)\Psi. \label{eqn:lax-pair-b}
\end{align}
To see this, we begin by enforcing sufficient smoothness of $\Psi$ and
therefore have it satisfy the compatibility condition $\Psi_{yt} =
\Psi_{ty}$. Rewriting $\Psi_{yt}$ and $\Psi_{ty}$ solely in terms of
$x$-derivatives of $\Psi$ and grouping by derivative order we obtain
\begin{align} \label{eqn:compatibility-expansion}
  \Psi_{yt}
  &=
  \Psi_{5x} + \tfrac{5}{2}u \Psi_{xxx} +
  \left( \tfrac{15}{4} u_x + \tfrac{3}{4} w \right)\Psi_{xx} + \notag \\
  &=
  \left( 3u_{xx} + \tfrac{3}{2} w_x + \tfrac{3}{2} u^2 \right)\Psi_x +
  \left( u_t + \tfrac{3}{4} u_{xxx} + \tfrac{3}{4} w_{xx} + [XXX]
  \tfrac{3}{4}u_x + \tfrac{3}{4} w \right) \Psi,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
  \Psi_{yt}
  &=
  \Psi_{5x} + \tfrac{5}{2}u \Psi_{xxx} +
  \left( \tfrac{15}{4} u_x + \tfrac{3}{4} w \right)\Psi_{xx} + \notag \\
  &=
  \left( 3u_{xx} + \tfrac{3}{2} w_x + \tfrac{3}{2} u^2 \right)\Psi_x +
  \left( u_t + \tfrac{3}{4} u_{xxx} + \tfrac{3}{4} w_{xx} + [XXX]
  \tfrac{3}{4}u_x + \tfrac{3}{4} w \right) \Psi.
\end{align}

Given the Lax pair formulation of KP a natural question to ask is
