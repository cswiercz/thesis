\subsection{Real Non-singular Solutions}

\begin{quote}
  We introduce the concept of a real Riemann surface with symmetric homology
  basis. These are necessary
\end{quote}


Although every Riemann surface can lead to a solution to the KP equation they
are often complex and have singularities. For applications, such as water waves
and plasma physics, it is important to identify the real and smooth solutions.
